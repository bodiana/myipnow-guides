# How to Check Your Public IP Address (IPv4 & IPv6 Explained)

Knowing your public [IP address](https://myipnow.net) is often the first step in diagnosing
connectivity problems, understanding network exposure, or verifying how
your device appears on the internet. This guide explains what a public
IP address is, how IPv4 and IPv6 differ, and when checking your IP is useful.

## What Is a Public IP Address?

A public IP address is the identifier assigned to your network connection
by an internet service provider. It is visible to websites, servers, and
other services you connect to online.

Public IPs are different from private IP addresses (such as `192.168.x.x`
or `10.x.x.x`), which are used only inside local networks.

## IPv4 vs IPv6

Most networks still use IPv4, a numerical format such as:
203.0.113.42

IPv6 was introduced to address IPv4 exhaustion and looks like:
2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334

Many modern networks support both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously, which
means a device may have more than one public-facing address.

## Why You Might Need to Check Your IP Address

Checking a public IP address is commonly done to:

- Confirm how a connection appears externally
- Troubleshoot access or routing problems
- Verify whether an IP has changed
- Check location-based access or restrictions
- Investigate whether an IP appears on blocklists

This step is often performed before deeper troubleshooting such as DNS
analysis or firewall inspection.

## How to Check Your Public IP Address

The simplest method is to use a browser-based lookup tool that reports
the IP address seen by external services.

Utilities like [MyIPNow](https://myipnow.net) provide a quick way to view both IPv4 and IPv6
addresses without installing software, along with related context such as
basic routing or visibility information.

Using a web-based tool ensures the result reflects how your connection
is seen from outside your local network.

## Things to Keep in Mind

- VPNs and proxies will change the visible public IP
- Mobile networks may rotate IPs frequently
- IPv6 addresses can behave differently than IPv4
- Restarting a modem may assign a new address

Understanding these factors helps avoid confusion when comparing results.

## Summary

A public IP address is a fundamental part of how devices communicate on
the internet. Knowing whether you are using IPv4, IPv6, or both, and
understanding how your IP appears externally, is essential for basic
network diagnostics and security awareness.
